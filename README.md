# 0g-typeahead
A lean typeahead library. Single file. Less then 400 lines of code.

It is a continuation of <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/commits/501aabf5723584eb0d1fba9569226f1b726a51b3/js/bootstrap-typeahead.js">bootstrap-typeahead.js</a> by Twitter.

Currently it needs jQuery. This dependency should be removed at some point.
